  1st run is not random but produces a different result than all subsequent runs, which are also not random
** DONE Do tests with ReFine & ReFineMod

  Seems to be about equal in performance
** DONE Try removing ReLU

  Does not change much? More testing needed
** TODO Do tests with ReFine & ReFine without both model list and ReLU
** TODO See if we can reduce complexity with modified ReFine to speed up training

* ReFine thoughts
1. Train on a dataset of graphs belonging to C classes
2. Model learns a global view of these classes into C models
3. Then fine-tune before each local explanation on the graph being explained
